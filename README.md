# Line Suitability Index (LSI)
Line Suitability Index (LSI) is a relative metric of wildfire control line quality based on a quantile-normalized combination of Potential Control Location Suitability (PCL) and Suppression Difficulty Index (SDI). PCL is a statistical modeling framework for estimating control potential by relating observations of past fire control successes and failures to landscape characteristics (e.g., fuels, topography, and accessibility).
