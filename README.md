# Line Suitability Index (LSI)
Line Suitability Index (LSI) is a relative metric of wildfire control line quality based on a quantile-normalized combination of Potential Control Location Suitability (PCL) and Suppression Difficulty Index (SDI). PCL is a statistical modeling framework for estimating control potential by relating observations of past fire control successes and failures to landscape characteristics (e.g., fuels, topography, and accessibility). PCL values range between 0 and 100 with higher numbers indicating greater potential for control. SDI is an expert-based index of suppression difficulty with potential fire behavior as a driving force in the numerator and factors that facilitate suppression as resisting forces in the denominator. SDI values range between 0 and 320 with higher values indicating greater suppression difficulty.
